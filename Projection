Projection:

A projection query is a query where you specify which fields should be returned.

You can do this by including the field names in your query, and adding a 1 or 0 next to them, 
to specify whether it should be returned or not. This is a projection parameter. 
A projection parameter of 1 will display the field and a 0 will hide it.

Example
First let's do a query without projection (so we can see how many fields are returned):

Without Projection:

>db.inspections.find( {"result": "Violation Issued"} )

Result:

With Projection
Now, let's use projection to display just the name field:

>db.inspections.find( { "result": "Violation Issued" }, { "_id":0,"date": 1 ,"result":1} )

Result:


You will notice that the _id field is automatically included, even if you don't specify it. You can exclude this field by using a 0 against it:

>db.inspections.find( { "result": "Violation Issued" }, { _id: 0, "date": 1 } )

Result:

You can't mix 1s(inclusion) and 0s(Exclusion)

>db.inspections.find( { "result": "Violation Issued" }, { "date": 1, "sector":0 } )

You'll end up with this error:
Error Result:
